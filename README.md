# NEAR Digital Collective - Constitution

<div align="justify">
The NEAR Digital Collective (NDC) is the collective representation of the NEAR ecosystem, made up of nodes of users, projects, stakeholders, partners, and backers. Collectively, the NDC is focused on stewarding pragmatic decentralization that reflects and involves the full scope of our community.

## VALUES
- Ecosystem-First.
- Transparency.
- Pragmatism over Perfection.
- Openness.
- Make it feel simple.
- Grow constantly.
- Minimize Politics.
- Results-oriented objectivity.


## OBJECTIVES

### Art. 1 - The NDC's objectives are to:

1. Balance, implement and supervise the NEAR ecosystem in a decentralized manner.
2. Provide assistance and support to NEAR community members in order to better execute their participation and work.
3. Organize tasks in a way that takes advantage of members' capacity, distributing them according to their collective skills and interests.
4. Provide, through affiliated "nodes" structures, development, funding, best practices, technical, legal and social services.

## MEMBERS
### Art. 2 - The NDC is composed of a variety of "nodes", including users, projects, stakeholders, partners, and backers. Each of these nodes has its own internal structures and autonomy to manage their goals, internal organization, teams, and on-chain governance.

> § 1.º However, there are established processes and practices that must be followed when these "nodes" act in certain situations, such as representing the collective in limited circumstances, making requests to the Treasury, or other acts. This ensures a certain cohesiveness and consistency in how the NDC is represented, conducts its interests and business.
